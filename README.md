## Mathematical distortion and signal mangling

This is the accurate [Faust][] reproduction of a VST plug-in I wrote
around 2003.  It features some sort of overdrive (see source code for
exact formula), LFO-modulated bit reduction and the possibility of
calculating the modulo of a signal.  I have never heard anything like
it, which is why I finally release it to the wild.

**Please be careful, this thing gets super-loud fast...**
