## Mathematical distortion and signal mangling

**Version 1.0** is the accurate [Faust][] reproduction of a VST
plug-in I wrote in 2003.  In later versions, I have modified the
parameter ranges and added some new functionality.

This signal mangler features a weird king of overdrive (see source
code for exact formula), a hard-clip distortion, LFO-modulated bit
reduction and the possibility of calculating the modulo of a signal.
I have never heard anything like it, which is why I finally release it
to the wild.

**In case you choose to use the old version 1.0, be very careful!
  This thing gets super-loud faster than you can say
  "thingamajig"...**
